                    <p>The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system, that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.</p><br />

                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> One day on Mercury (the time it takes for Mercury to rotate or spin once with respect to the stars) takes 59 Earth days. One day-night cycle on Mercury takes 175.97 Earth days. Mercury makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Mercury time) in just 88 Earth days.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> Mercury is a rocky planet, also known as a terrestrial planet. Mercury has a solid, cratered surface, much like the Earth's moon.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> Mercury's thin atmosphere, or exosphere, is composed mostly of oxygen (O2), sodium (Na), hydrogen (H2), helium (He), and potassium (K). Atoms that are blasted off the surface by the solar wind and micrometeoroid impacts create Mercury's exosphere.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> No evidence for life has been found on Mercury. Daytime Temperatures can reach 430 degrees Celsius (800 degrees Fahrenheit) and drop to -180 degrees Celsius (-290 degrees Fahrenheit) at night. It is unlikely life (as we know it) could survive on this planet.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> Mercury has no moons.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> Standing on Mercury's surface at its closest approach to the Sun, our star would appear more than three times larger than it does on Earth.</li>
                      <li className="w-1/2 md:w-1/3 my-12 p-4"><i class="fas fa-satellite-dish"></i> The two spacecraft of ESA-JAXA's BepiColombo are en route to Mercury. NASA's Mariner 10 was the first mission to explore Mercury. NASA's MESSENGER was the first to orbit the innermost planet.</li>
